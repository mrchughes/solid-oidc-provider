# Solid OIDC Provider Implementation Plan

Based on the test results, we need to implement several endpoints and features to meet the Solid OIDC specification requirements. This document outlines the implementation plan.

## Current Status

The test results indicate that our implementation is missing several critical endpoints and features:

1. **Authorization Flow**: Missing proper `/authorize` endpoint implementation with PKCE support
2. **Token Exchange**: Missing proper `/token` endpoint for authorization code and refresh token exchanges
3. **Account Management**: Missing session management and consent management endpoints
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Missing 2FA setup and verification endpoints

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Core OIDC Configuration

- **Fix OIDC Discovery**: Ensure `/.well-known/openid-configuration` properly includes all required endpoints
- **Update JWKS Endpoint**: Ensure JSON Web Key Set is properly formatted

### 2. Client Registration

- **Enhance Client Registration**: Update `/register` endpoint to return proper client credentials
- **Implement Dynamic Client Registration**: Support OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration Protocol

### 3. Authorization Flow

- **Implement Authorization Endpoint**: Create full `/authorize` endpoint implementation
- **Add PKCE Support**: Support Proof Key for Code Exchange for enhanced security
- **Implement Login Flow**: Connect authorization endpoint to login process

### 4. Token Exchange

- **Implement Token Endpoint**: Create `/token` endpoint for various grant types
- **Support Authorization Code Flow**: Exchange authorization codes for tokens
- **Support Refresh Tokens**: Allow token refresh without user interaction
- **Add WebID Claim**: Include WebID claim in ID tokens

### 5. Account Management

- **Create Sessions Endpoint**: Implement `/user/sessions` for viewing active sessions
- **Create Consent Management**: Implement `/user/consent/:client_id` for revoking consent

### 6. Two-Factor Authentication

- **Create 2FA Setup**: Implement `/user/2fa/setup` for initializing 2FA
- **Create 2FA Verification**: Implement `/user/2fa/verify` for verifying 2FA codes

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Core OIDC Configuration and Authorization Flow** (High Priority)
   - Fix the discovery document and implement the authorization endpoint with PKCE
   - Implement the token endpoint for authorization code exchange

2. **Client Registration and WebID Support** (High Priority)
   - Enhance client registration to fully support the Solid OIDC requirements
   - Ensure all tokens include the WebID claim

3. **Account Management** (Medium Priority)
   - Implement session and consent management endpoints

4. **Two-Factor Authentication** (Medium Priority)
   - Implement 2FA setup and verification

## Next Steps

1. Update the OIDC configuration in `src/config/oidc.js` to ensure all endpoints are properly configured
2. Implement the missing endpoints in the respective route handlers
3. Update the controllers to handle the new endpoints
4. Enhance the test coverage to verify all implemented endpoints

## Implementation Timeline

| Task | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Fix OIDC Discovery Configuration | 1 day | High |
| Implement Authorization Endpoint | 2 days | High |
| Implement Token Endpoint | 2 days | High |
| Enhance Client Registration | 1 day | High |
| Implement Account Management | 2 days | Medium |
| Implement 2FA | 2 days | Medium |

## Expected Results

After completing the implementation, all Postman tests should pass, confirming that our Solid OIDC Provider implementation meets all the required specifications.
