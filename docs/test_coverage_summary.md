# Solid OIDC Provider Test Coverage Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the test coverage improvements made to the Solid OIDC Provider service to ensure all required API endpoints from the specification are properly tested.

## Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Test Coverage**
   - Created a comprehensive additional test collection (`solid_oidc_additional_tests.json`) to test all required API endpoints
   - Added tests for authorization flow with PKCE, token exchange, refresh tokens, and account management
   - Added unit and integration tests for core components (JWT, validation, 2FA, email)
   - Ensured all must-pass requirements from the specification are covered

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Updated test runner scripts to handle multiple collections
   - Created an enhanced test summary script for better reporting
   - Added proper environment variable handling for tests
   - Added unit test mocks for external dependencies

3. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive test plan document (`TEST_COVERAGE.md`)
   - Added detailed explanation of additional tests (`ADDITIONAL_TESTS.md`)
   - Added documentation for new test files
   - Updated README with information about the enhanced test coverage

4. **Implementation**
   - Updated OIDC configuration file with proper settings for all required features
   - Added test files for all core components
   - Enhanced test coverage for critical security features
